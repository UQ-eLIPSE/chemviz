## Setup and Install

The build tools use gulp, thus `node.js` is required.

Once node.js is installed run `npm install` and then `gulp` to build the project.

Once built the files can be found under the directory named `build`

To run the development server, run `gulp run`

To run the tests, run `gulp test run` and then visit `127.0.0.1:8000/tests.html`

To generate docs, run `gulp docs`. The docs will then be generated within the `doc` folder
